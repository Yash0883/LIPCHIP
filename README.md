DeepSpeech2-Based Speech-to-Text Model: Audio Preprocessing, Model Training, and Evaluation with Word Error Rate (WER)
Needed data set will be directly downloaded once code is executed 
This is DeepLearning Neural Network Based Code
The code builds and trains a speech-to-text model using DeepSpeech2 architecture. It processes an audio dataset (LJ Speech) and predicts text transcriptions from the audio input. 
The code handles reading and preprocessing audio data, creating spectrograms, mapping transcriptions to numerical values, building the neural network model, and evaluating the modelâ€™s performance with the Word Error Rate (WER) metric.
Main Code is in LIPCHIP
